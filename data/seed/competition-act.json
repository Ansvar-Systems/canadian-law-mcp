(1.1) On application by or on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada or the attorney general of a province, a court may issue an injunction forbidding any person named in the application from doing any act or thing that it appears to the court could constitute or be directed toward the commission of an offence under section 52 involving the use of any means of telecommunication or an offence under section 52.01, 52.1 or 53, if it appears to the court that (a) the person has done, is about to do or is likely to do any act or thing constituting or directed toward the commission of the offence; (b) if the offence is committed or continued, serious harm is likely to ensue unless the injunction is issued; and (c) the balance of convenience favours issuing the injunction. (1.2) On application by or on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada or the attorney general of a province, a court may issue an injunction ordering any person named in the application to refrain from supplying to another person a product that it appears to the court is or is likely to be used to commit or continue an offence under section 52 involving the use of any means of telecommunication or an offence under section 52.01, 52.1 or 53, or to do any act or thing that it appears to the court could prevent the commission or continuation of such an offence, if it appears to the court that (a) a person has done, is about to do or is likely to do any act or thing constituting or directed toward the commission of the offence; (b) if the offence is committed or continued, serious harm is likely to ensue unless the injunction is issued; and (c) the balance of convenience favours issuing the injunction. (2) Subject to subsection (3), at least 48 hours’ notice of an application for an injunction under subsection (1), (1.1) or (1.2) shall be given by or on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada or the attorney general of a province, as the case may be, to each person against whom the injunction is sought. (3) If a court to which an application is made under subsection (1), (1.1) or (1.2) is satisfied that subsection (2) cannot reasonably be complied with, or that the urgency of the situation is such that service of notice in accordance with subsection (2) would not be in the public interest, it may proceed with the application ex parte but any injunction issued under subsection (1), (1.1) or (1.2) by the court on ex parte application has effect only for the period, not exceeding 10 days, that is specified in the order. (4) An injunction issued under subsection (1), (1.1) or (1.2) (a) shall be in the terms that the court that issues it considers necessary and sufficient to meet the circumstances of the case; and (b) subject to subsection (3), has effect for the period that is specified in the order. (5) On application by or on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada or the attorney general of a province, as the case may be, or by or on behalf of any person to whom the injunction is directed, on at least 48 hours’ notice of the application to all other parties to the injunction, a court that issues an injunction under subsection (1), (1.1) or (1.2) may, by order, (a) despite subsections (3) and (4), continue the injunction, with or without modification, for any definite period that is specified in the order; or (b) revoke the injunction. (6) If an injunction is issued under subsection (1), (1.1) or (1.2), the Attorney General of Canada or the attorney general of a province, as the case may be, shall proceed as expeditiously as possible to institute and conclude any prosecution or proceedings arising out of the acts or things on the basis of which the injunction was issued. (7) A court may punish any person who contravenes an injunction issued by it under subsection (1), (1.1) or (1.2) by a fine in the discretion of the court or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.

(3.1) The Attorney General of Canada or the attorney general of the province or any person against whom an order is made under this section may appeal against the order or a refusal to make an order or the quashing of an order from the court of appeal of the province or the Federal Court of Appeal, as the case may be, to the Supreme Court of Canada on any ground that involves a question of law or, if leave to appeal is granted by the Supreme Court, on any ground that appears to that Court to be a sufficient ground of appeal. (4) Where the court of appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada allows an appeal, it may quash any order made by the court appealed from, and may make any order that in its opinion the court appealed from could and should have made. (5) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), Part XXI of the Criminal Code applies with such modifications as the circumstances require to appeals under this section. (6) A court may punish any person who contravenes an order made under this section by a fine in the discretion of the court or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. (7) Any proceedings pursuant to an information of the Attorney General of Canada or the attorney general of a province under this section shall be tried by the court without a jury, and the procedure applicable in injunction proceedings in the superior courts of the province shall, in so far as possible, apply.

(3) No person who engages in telemarketing shall (a) make a representation that is false or misleading in a material respect; (b) conduct or purport to conduct a contest, lottery or game of chance, skill or mixed chance and skill, where (i) the delivery of a prize or other benefit to a participant in the contest, lottery or game is, or is represented to be, conditional on the prior payment of any amount by the participant, or (ii) adequate and fair disclosure is not made of the number and approximate value of the prizes, of the area or areas to which they relate and of any fact within the person’s knowledge, that affects materially the chances of winning; (c) offer a product at no cost, or at a price less than the fair market value of the product, in consideration of the supply or use of another product, unless fair, reasonable and timely disclosure is made of the fair market value of the first product and of any restrictions, terms or conditions applicable to its supply to the purchaser; or (d) offer a product for sale at a price grossly in excess of its fair market value, where delivery of the product is, or is represented to be, conditional on prior payment by the purchaser. (4) In a prosecution for a contravention of paragraph (3)(a), the general impression conveyed by a representation as well as its literal meaning shall be taken into account in determining whether or not the representation is false or misleading in a material respect. (5) The disclosure of information referred to in paragraph (2)(b) or (c) or (3)(b) or (c) must be made during the course of a communication unless it is established by the accused that the information was disclosed within a reasonable time before the communication, by any means, and the information was not requested during the communication. (6) No person shall be convicted of an offence under this section who establishes that the person exercised due diligence to prevent the commission of the offence. (7) Notwithstanding subsection (6), in the prosecution of a corporation for an offence under this section, it is sufficient proof of the offence to establish that it was committed by an employee or agent of the corporation, whether or not the employee or agent is identified, unless the corporation establishes that the corporation exercised due diligence to prevent the commission of the offence. (8) Where a corporation commits an offence under this section, any officer or director of the corporation who is in a position to direct or influence the policies of the corporation in respect of conduct prohibited by this section is a party to and guilty of the offence and is liable to the punishment provided for the offence, whether or not the corporation has been prosecuted or convicted, unless the officer or director establishes that the officer or director exercised due diligence to prevent the commission of the offence. (9) Any person who contravenes subsection (2) or (3) is guilty of an offence and liable (a) on conviction on indictment, to a fine in the discretion of the court or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years, or to both; or (b) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding $200,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or to both. (10) In sentencing a person convicted of an offence under this section, the court shall consider, among other factors, the following aggravating factors: (a) the use of lists of persons previously deceived by means of telemarketing; (b) characteristics of the persons to whom the telemarketing was directed, including classes of persons who are especially vulnerable to abusive tactics; (c) the amount of the proceeds realized by the person from the telemarketing; (d) previous convictions of the person under this section or under section 52 in respect of conduct prohibited by this section; and (e) the manner in which information is conveyed, including the use of abusive tactics.

(2) Subject to subsection (3), a person engages in reviewable conduct who, for the purpose of promoting, directly or indirectly, the supply or use of a product or for the purpose of promoting, directly or indirectly, any business interest, by any means whatever, makes a representation to the public concerning the price at which a product or like products have been, are or will be ordinarily supplied where suppliers generally in the relevant geographic market, having regard to the nature of the product, (a) have not sold a substantial volume of the product at that price or a higher price within a reasonable period of time before or after the making of the representation, as the case may be; and (b) have not offered the product at that price or a higher price in good faith for a substantial period of time recently before or immediately after the making of the representation, as the case may be.

(4) For greater certainty, whether the period of time to be considered in paragraphs (2)(a) and (b) and (3)(a) and (b) is before or after the making of the representation depends on whether the representation relates to (a) the price at which products have been or are supplied; or (b) the price at which products will be supplied.

(1.1) An order made under subsection (1) does not apply in the case of an article if, within the specified time, any customs duties on the article are removed, reduced or remitted and the effect of the removal, reduction or remission is to place the person on an equal footing with other persons who are able to obtain adequate supplies of the article in Canada. (1.2) If the Tribunal makes an order under subsection (1) as the result of an application by a person granted leave under section 103.1, it may also order any supplier in respect of whom the order applies to pay an amount, not exceeding the value of the benefit derived from the conduct that is the subject of the order, to be distributed among the applicant and any other person affected by the conduct, in any manner that the Tribunal considers appropriate. (1.3) The Tribunal may specify in an order made under subsection (1.2) any term that it considers necessary for the order’s implementation, including a term (a) specifying how the payment is to be administered; (b) respecting the appointment of an administrator to administer the payment and specifying the terms of administration; (c) requiring the person against whom the order is made to pay the administrative costs related to the payment as well as the fees to be paid to an administrator; (d) requiring that potential claimants be notified in the time and manner specified by the Tribunal; (e) specifying the time and manner for making claims; (f) specifying the conditions for the eligibility of claimants, including conditions relating to the return of the products to the person against whom the order is made; and (g) providing for the manner in which, and the terms on which, any amount of the payment that remains unclaimed or undistributed is to be dealt with. (2) For the purposes of this section, an article is not a separate product in a market only because it is differentiated from other articles in its class by a trademark, proprietary name or the like, unless the article so differentiated occupies such a dominant position in that market as to substantially affect the ability of a person to carry on business in that class of articles unless that person has access to the article so differentiated.

(5) For the purposes of this section, a suggestion by a producer or supplier of a product of a resale price or minimum resale price for the product, however arrived at, is proof that the person to whom the suggestion is made is influenced in accordance with the suggestion, in the absence of proof that the producer or supplier, in so doing, also made it clear to the person that they were under no obligation to accept the suggestion and would in no way suffer in their business relations with the producer or supplier or with any other person if they failed to accept the suggestion. (6) For the purposes of this section, the publication by a producer or supplier of a product, other than a retailer, of an advertisement that mentions a resale price for the product is proof that the producer or supplier is influencing upward the selling price of any person to whom the product comes for resale, unless the price is expressed in a way that makes it clear to any person whose attention the advertisement comes to that the product may be sold at a lower price.

( ventes liées ) (2) Where, on application by the Commissioner or a person granted leave under section 103.1, the Tribunal finds that exclusive dealing or tied selling, because it is engaged in by a major supplier of a product in a market or because it is widespread in a market, is likely to (a) impede entry into or expansion of a firm in a market, (b) impede introduction of a product into or expansion of sales of a product in a market, or (c) have any other exclusionary effect in a market, with the result that competition is or is likely to be lessened substantially, the Tribunal may make an order directed to all or any of the suppliers against whom an order is sought prohibiting them from continuing to engage in that exclusive dealing or tied selling and containing any other requirement that, in its opinion, is necessary to overcome the effects thereof in the market or to restore or stimulate competition in the market. (3) Where, on application by the Commissioner or a person granted leave under section 103.1, the Tribunal finds that market restriction, because it is engaged in by a major supplier of a product or because it is widespread in relation to a product, is likely to substantially lessen competition in relation to the product, the Tribunal may make an order directed to all or any of the suppliers against whom an order is sought prohibiting them from continuing to engage in market restriction and containing any other requirement that, in its opinion, is necessary to restore or stimulate competition in relation to the product. (3.1) If the Tribunal makes an order under subsection (2) or (3) as the result of an application by a person granted leave under section 103.1, it may also order any supplier in respect of whom the order applies to pay an amount, not exceeding the value of the benefit derived from the conduct that is the subject of the order, to be distributed among the applicant and any other person affected by the conduct, in any manner that the Tribunal considers appropriate. (3.2) The Tribunal may specify in an order made under subsection (3.1) any term that it considers necessary for the order’s implementation, including any term referred to in any of paragraphs 75(1.3)(a) to (g). (4) The Tribunal shall not make an order under this section where, in its opinion, (a) exclusive dealing or market restriction is or will be engaged in only for a reasonable period of time to facilitate entry of a new supplier of a product into a market or of a new product into a market, (b) tied selling that is engaged in is reasonable having regard to the technological relationship between or among the products to which it applies, or (c) tied selling that is engaged in by a person in the business of lending money is for the purpose of better securing loans made by that person and is reasonably necessary for that purpose. No order made under this section applies in respect of exclusive dealing, market restriction or tied selling between or among entities that are affiliated. (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), in addition to the circumstances specified in paragraph 2(2)(a) or (b) under which two entities are affiliated, an entity is affiliated with another entity in respect of any agreement between them in which one of them grants to the other the right to use a trademark or trade name to identify the business of the grantee, if (a) the business is related to the sale or distribution, in accordance with a marketing plan or system prescribed substantially by the grantor, of a multiplicity of products obtained from competing sources of supply and a multiplicity of suppliers; and (b) no one product dominates the business. (6) For the purposes of subsection (4) in its application to market restriction, where there is an agreement whereby one person (the “first” person) supplies or causes to be supplied to another person (the “second” person) an ingredient or ingredients that the second person processes by the addition of labour and material into an article of food or drink that he then sells in association with a trademark that the first person owns or in respect of which the first person is a registered user, the first person and the second person are deemed, in respect of the agreement, to be affiliated. (7) In considering an application by a person granted leave under section 103.1, the Tribunal may not draw any inference from the fact that the Commissioner has or has not taken any action in respect of the matter raised by the application.

      "content": "79 (1) On application by the Commissioner or a person granted leave under section 103.1, if the Tribunal finds that one or more persons substantially or completely control a class or species of business throughout Canada or any area of Canada, it may make an order prohibiting the person or persons from engaging in a practice or conduct if it finds that the person or persons have engaged in or are engaging in (a) a practice of anti-competitive acts; or (b) conduct (i) that had, is having or is likely to have the effect of preventing or lessening competition substantially in a market in which the person or persons have a plausible competitive interest, and (ii) the effect is not a result of superior competitive performance. (2) If, on an application under subsection (1), the Tribunal finds that a practice of anti-competitive acts amounts to conduct that has had or is having the effect of preventing or lessening competition substantially in a market in which the person or persons have a plausible competitive interest and that an order under subsection (1) is not likely to restore competition in that market, the Tribunal may, in addition to or in lieu of making an order under subsection (1), make an order directing any or all persons against whom an order is sought to take actions, including the divestiture of assets or shares, that are reasonable and necessary to overcome the effects of the practice in that market. (3) In making an order under subsection (2), the Tribunal shall make the order in such terms as will in its opinion interfere with the rights of any person to whom the order is directed or any other person affected by it only to the extent necessary to achieve the purpose of the order. (3.1) If the Tribunal finds that a person has engaged in or is engaging in a practice of anti-competitive acts that amounts to conduct that has had or is having the effect of preventing or lessening competition substantially in a market in which the person has a plausible competitive interest and it makes an order against the person under subsection (1) or (2), it may also order them to pay, in any manner that it specifies, an administrative monetary penalty in an amount not exceeding the greater of (a) $25,000,000 and, for each subsequent order under either of those subsections, an amount not exceeding $35,000,000, and (b) three times the value of the benefit derived from the anti-competitive practice, or, if that amount cannot be reasonably determined, 3% of the person’s annual worldwide gross revenues. (3.2) In determining the amount of an administrative monetary penalty, the Tribunal shall take into account any evidence of the following: (a) the effect on competition in the relevant market; (b) the gross revenue from sales affected by the practice; (c) any actual or anticipated profits affected by the practice; (d) the financial position of the person against whom the order is made; (d.1) the amount that the person against whom the order is made is required to pay under an order made under subsection (4.1); (e) the history of compliance with this Act by the person against whom the order is made; and (f) any other relevant factor. (3.3) The purpose of an order made against a person under subsection (3.1) is to promote practices by that person that are in conformity with the purposes of this section and not to punish that person. (4) In determining, for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), whether conduct has had, is having or is likely to have the effect of preventing or lessening competition substantially in a market, the Tribunal may consider (a) the effect of the conduct on barriers to entry in the market, including network effects; (b) the effect of the conduct on price or non-price competition, including quality, choice or consumer privacy; (c) the nature and extent of change and innovation in a relevant market; and (d) any other factor that is relevant to competition in the market that is or would be affected by the conduct. (4.1) If, as the result of an application by a person granted leave under section 103.1, the Tribunal finds that a person has engaged in or is engaging in a practice of anti-competitive acts that amounts to conduct that has had or is having the effect of preventing or lessening competition substantially in a market in which the person has a plausible competitive interest and it makes an order under subsection (1) or (2) against the person, it may also order the person against whom the order is made to pay an amount, not exceeding the value of the benefit derived from the conduct that is the subject of the order, to be distributed among the applicant and any other person affected by the conduct, in any manner that the Tribunal considers appropriate. (4.2) The Tribunal may specify in an order made under subsection (4.1) any term that it considers necessary for the order’s implementation, including any term referred to in any of paragraphs 75(1.3)(a) to (g). (5) For the purpose of this section, an act engaged in pursuant only to the exercise of any right or enjoyment of any interest derived under the Copyright Act , Industrial Design Act , Integrated Circuit Topography Act , Patent Act , Trademarks Act or any other Act of Parliament pertaining to intellectual or industrial property is not an anti-competitive act. (6) No application may be made under this section in respect of a practice of anti-competitive acts or conduct more than three years after the practice or conduct has ceased. (7) No application may be made under this section against a person on the basis of facts that are the same or substantially the same as the facts on the basis of which (a) proceedings have been commenced against that person under section 45 or 49; or (b) an order against that person has been made under section 76, 90.1 or 92. (8) In considering an application by a person granted leave under section 103.1, the Tribunal may not draw any inference from the fact that the Commissioner has or has not taken any action in respect of the matter raised by the application.

(1.01) If the Tribunal finds that a significant purpose of the agreement or arrangement, or any part of it, is to prevent or lessen competition in any market, it may make an order under subsection (1) even if none of the persons referred to in that subsection are competitors. (1.1) If, on an application under subsection (1), the Tribunal finds that an agreement or arrangement has had or is having the effect of preventing or lessening competition substantially in a market and that an order under subsection (1) is not likely to restore competition in that market, the Tribunal may, in addition to or in lieu of making an order under subsection (1), make an order directing any or all the persons against whom an order is sought to take actions, including the divestiture of assets or shares, that are reasonable and as are necessary to overcome the effects of the agreement or arrangement in that market. (1.2) In making an order under subsection (1.1), the Tribunal shall make the order in such terms as will in its opinion interfere with the rights of any person to whom the order is directed or any other person affected by it only to the extent necessary to achieve the purpose of the order. (1.3) If the Tribunal makes an order against a person under subsection (1) or (1.1), it may also order them to pay, in any manner that the Tribunal specifies, an administrative monetary penalty in an amount not exceeding the greater of (a) $10,000,000 and, for each subsequent order under either of those subsections, an amount not exceeding $15,000,000, and (b) three times the value of the benefit derived from the agreement or arrangement, or, if that amount cannot be reasonably determined, 3% of the person’s annual worldwide gross revenues. (1.4) In determining the amount of an administrative monetary penalty, the Tribunal shall take into account any evidence of the following: (a) the effect on competition in the relevant market; (b) the gross revenue from sales affected by the agreement or arrangement; (c) any actual or anticipated profits affected by the agreement or arrangement; (d) the financial position of the person against whom the order is made; (d.1) any amount that the person against whom the order is made is required to pay under an order made under subsection (10.1); (e) the history of compliance with this Act by the person against whom the order is made; and (f) any other relevant factor. (1.5) The purpose of an order made against a person under subsection (1.3) is to promote practices by that person that are in conformity with the purposes of this section and not to punish that person. (2) In deciding whether to make the finding referred to in subsection (1), the Tribunal may have regard to the following factors: (a) the extent to which foreign products or foreign competitors provide or are likely to provide effective competition to the businesses of the parties to the agreement or arrangement; (b) the extent to which acceptable substitutes for products supplied by the parties to the agreement or arrangement are or are likely to be available; (c) any barriers to entry into the market, including (i) tariff and non-tariff barriers to international trade, (ii) interprovincial barriers to trade, and (iii) regulatory control over entry; (d) any effect of the agreement or arrangement on the barriers referred to in paragraph (c); (e) the extent to which effective competition remains or would remain in the market; (f) any removal of a vigorous and effective competitor that resulted from the agreement or arrangement, or any likelihood that the agreement or arrangement will or would result in the removal of such a competitor; (g) the nature and extent of change and innovation in any relevant market; (g.1) network effects within the market; (g.2) whether the agreement or arrangement would contribute to the entrenchment of the market position of leading incumbents; (g.3) any effect of the agreement or arrangement on price or non-price competition, including quality, choice or consumer privacy; and (h) any other factor that is relevant to competition in the market that is or would be affected by the agreement or arrangement. (3) For the purpose of subsections (1) and (2), the Tribunal shall not make the finding solely on the basis of evidence of concentration or market share.

(8) Subsection (1) does not apply if the agreement or arrangement relates only to the export of products from Canada, unless the agreement or arrangement (a) has resulted in or is likely to result in a reduction or limitation of the real value of exports of a product; (b) has restricted or is likely to restrict any person from entering into or expanding the business of exporting products from Canada; or (c) has prevented or lessened or is likely to prevent or lessen competition substantially in the supply of services that facilitate the export of products from Canada. (9) The Tribunal shall not make an order under subsection (1) in respect of (a) an agreement or arrangement between federal financial institutions, as defined in subsection 49(3), in respect of which the Minister of Finance has certified to the Commissioner (i) the names of the parties to the agreement or arrangement, and (ii) the Minister of Finance’s request for or approval of the agreement or arrangement for the purposes of financial policy; (b) an agreement or arrangement that constitutes a merger or proposed merger under the Bank Act , the Cooperative Credit Associations Act , the Insurance Companies Act or the Trust and Loan Companies Act in respect of which the Minister of Finance has certified to the Commissioner (i) the names of the parties to the agreement or arrangement, and (ii) the Minister of Finance’s opinion that the merger is in the public interest, or that it would be in the public interest, taking into account any terms and conditions that may be imposed under those Acts; (c) an agreement or arrangement that constitutes a merger or proposed merger approved under subsection 53.2(7) of the Canada Transportation Act in respect of which the Minister of Transport has certified to the Commissioner the names of the parties to the agreement or arrangement; or (d) an agreement or arrangement that constitutes an existing or proposed arrangement , as defined in section 53.7 of the Canada Transportation Act , that has been authorized by the Minister of Transport under subsection 53.73(8) of that Act and for which the authorization has not been revoked. (9.1) No application may be made under this section in respect of an agreement or arrangement that has been terminated for more than three years. (9.2) The administrative monetary penalty imposed on a person under subsection (1.3) is a debt due to His Majesty in right of Canada and may be recovered as such from that person in a court of competent jurisdiction.

(2) For the purpose of this section, if the Tribunal finds, on a balance of probabilities, that a merger or proposed merger results or is likely to result in a significant increase in concentration or market share, the Tribunal shall also find that the merger or proposed merger prevents or lessens, or is likely to prevent or lessen, competition substantially, unless the contrary is proved on a balance of probabilities by the parties to the merger or proposed merger. (3) A merger or proposed merger results or is likely to result in a significant increase in concentration or market share if, in any relevant market, as a result of the merger or proposed merger, (a) the concentration index increases or is likely to increase by more than 100; and (b) either (i) the concentration index is or is likely to be more than 1,800, or (ii) the market share of the parties to the merger or proposed merger is or is likely to be more than 30%.

(5) The Tribunal shall as soon as practicable after receiving the Commissioner’s certification under subsection (3) notify the applicant and any person against whom the order is sought as to whether it can hear the application for leave. (6) A person served with an application for leave may, within 15 days after receiving notice under subsection (5), make representations in writing to the Tribunal and shall serve a copy of the representations on any other person referred to in subsection (2). (6.1) The Tribunal may grant leave to make an application under section 74.1 if it is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so. (7) The Tribunal may grant leave to make an application under section 75, 77, 79 or 90.1 if it has reason to believe that the applicant is directly and substantially affected in the whole or part of the applicant’s business by any conduct referred to in one of those sections that could be subject to an order under that section or if it is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so. (7.1) The Tribunal may grant leave to make an application under section 76 if it has reason to believe that the applicant is directly affected by any conduct referred to in that section that could be subject to an order under that section. (7.2) The Tribunal is not to consider an application for leave in respect of an application under section 90.1 that relates to an agreement or arrangement for which a certificate issued under subsection 124.3(1) is valid and registered. (8) The Tribunal may set the time within which and the conditions subject to which an application under section 74.1, 75, 76, 77, 79 or 90.1 must be made. The application must be made no more than one year after the practice or conduct that is the subject of the application has ceased. (9) The Tribunal must give written reasons for its decision to grant or refuse leave and send copies to the applicant, the Commissioner and any other person referred to in subsection (2). (10) The Commissioner may not make an application for an order under section 74.1, 75, 76, 77, 79 or 90.1 on the basis of the same or substantially the same facts as are alleged in a matter for which the Tribunal has granted leave under subsection (6.1), (7) or (7.1), if the person granted leave has already applied to the Tribunal under one of those sections. (11) In considering an application for leave, the Tribunal may not draw any inference from the fact that the Commissioner has or has not taken any action in respect of the matter raised by it. (12) If the Commissioner has certified under subsection (3) that a matter in respect of which leave was sought by a person is under inquiry and the Commissioner subsequently discontinues the inquiry other than by way of settlement, the Commissioner shall, as soon as practicable, notify that person that the inquiry is discontinued.

(2) The Tribunal may make the interim order if it finds that the conduct or measures could be of the type described in paragraph (1)(a) or (b) and that, in the absence of an interim order, (a) injury to competition that cannot adequately be remedied by the Tribunal is likely to occur; (b) a person is likely to be eliminated as a competitor; or (c) a person is likely to suffer a significant loss of market share, a significant loss of revenue or other harm that cannot be adequately remedied by the Tribunal. (3) Before making an application for an order to prevent the continuation of conduct that could be the subject of an order under any of sections 75 to 77, 79, 81, 84 or 90.1 by an entity incorporated under the Bank Act , the Insurance Companies Act , the Trust and Loan Companies Act or the Cooperative Credit Associations Act or a subsidiary of such an entity, the Commissioner must consult with the Minister of Finance respecting the safety and soundness of the entity. (4) Subject to subsections (5) and (6), an interim order has effect for 10 days, beginning on the day on which it is made. (5) The Tribunal may, on application by the Commissioner on 48 hours notice to each person against whom the interim order is directed, (a) extend the interim order once or twice for additional periods of 35 days each; or (b) rescind the order. (5.1) The Commissioner may, before the expiry of the second 35-day period referred to in subsection (5) or of the period fixed by the Tribunal under subsection (7), as the case may be, apply to the Tribunal for a further extension of the interim order. (5.2) The Commissioner shall give at least 48 hours notice of an application referred to in subsection (5.1) to the person against whom the interim order is made. (5.3) The Tribunal may order that the effective period of the interim order be extended if (a) the Commissioner establishes that information requested for the purpose of the inquiry has not yet been provided or that more time is needed in order to review the information; (b) the information was requested during the initial period that the interim order had effect, within the first 35 days after an order extending the interim order under subsection (5) had effect, or within the first 35 days after an order extending the interim order made under subsection (7) had effect, as the case may be, and (i) the provision of such information is the subject of a written undertaking, or (ii) the information was ordered to be provided under section 11; and (c) the information is reasonably required to determine whether grounds exist for the Commissioner to make an application under any section referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (b). (5.4) An order extending an interim order issued under subsection (5.3) shall have effect for such period as the Tribunal considers necessary to give the Commissioner a reasonable opportunity to receive and review the information referred to in that subsection. (5.5) If an application is made under subsection (5.1), the interim order has effect until the Tribunal makes a decision whether to grant an extension under subsection (5.3). (6) If an application is made under subsection (7), an interim order has effect until the Tribunal makes an order under that subsection. (7) A person against whom the Tribunal has made an interim order may apply to the Tribunal in the first 10 days during which the order has effect to have it varied or set aside and the Tribunal shall (a) if it is satisfied that one or more of the situations set out in paragraphs (2)(a) to (c) existed or are likely to exist, make an order confirming the interim order, with or without variation as the Tribunal considers necessary and sufficient to meet the circumstances, and fix the effective period of that order for a maximum of 70 days, beginning on the day on which the order confirming the interim order is made; and (b) if it is not satisfied that any of the situations set out in paragraphs (2)(a) to (c) existed or is likely to exist, make an order setting aside the interim order. (8) A person who makes an application under subsection (7) shall give the Commissioner 48 hours written notice of the application. (9) At the hearing of an application under subsection (7), the Tribunal shall provide the applicant, the Commissioner and any person directly affected by the interim order with a full opportunity to present evidence and make representations before the Tribunal makes an order under that subsection. (10) Notwithstanding section 13 of the Competition Tribunal Act , an interim order shall not be appealed or reviewed in any court except as provided for by subsection (7).
